# --- Core Classification Function ---

def classify_abstract(abstract_text: str) -> dict:
    """
    Sends the abstract to the Gemini model with detailed instructions for classification.
    Returns the classification label and reason as a dictionary.
    """
    # The detailed, multi-part prompt you provided, including role, labels, definitions, and few-shot examples
    prompt = f"""
You are a biomedical abstract triage assistant. I want you to classify PubMed abstracts into one of five categories. For each input, provide both a classification label and a brief reasoning statement.

Labels:

1. SkyClarys/Omaveloxolone
2. FA Mechanisms (Iron/Ferroptosis/ROS)
3. Other Drugs/Compounds Targeting Iron/Ferroptosis/ROS
4. General FA (Genetics/Clinical)
5. Irrelevant

---

The label definitions are as follows:
- SkyClarys/Omaveloxolone: Abstracts mentioning omaveloxolone (SkyClarys), bardoxolone methyl, or related analogs.
- FA Mechanisms: Abstracts about FA biology including frataxin deficiency, iron overload, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, ROS, lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis, GPX4.
- Other Drugs/Compounds: Abstracts about non-omaveloxolone drugs or compounds that modulate ferroptosis, GPX4, iron chelation, lipid peroxidation, or mitochondrial antioxidant pathways, even if studied in other diseases or models (exclude NRF2/KEAP1 activators).
- General FA: Abstracts about FA genetics, prevalence, natural history, or clinical scales, without mechanistic or therapeutic depth.
- Irrelevant: Everything else.

---

Here are several few-shot examples:

Example 1
Input: "In a phase II trial of omaveloxolone in Friedreichâ€™s ataxia, activation of NRF2 improved mFARS scores versus placebo."
Output (JSON only): {{"label":"SkyClarys/Omaveloxolone","reason":"Omaveloxolone activates NRF2 and was tested in FA patients."}}

Example 2
Input: "Frataxin deficiency causes mitochondrial iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation; GPX4 overexpression restored cell viability."
Output (JSON only): {{"label":"FA Mechanisms (Iron/Ferroptosis/ROS)","reason":"FA model shows ferroptosis via iron overload and GPX4 rescue."}}

Example 3
Input: "Ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, prevented lipid peroxidation and neuronal loss in a mouse model of Parkinsonâ€™s disease."
Output (JSON only): {{"label":"Other Drugs/Compounds Targeting Iron/Ferroptosis/ROS","reason":"Ferrostatin-1 blocks ferroptosis and lipid peroxidation, relevant for repurposing."}}

---

Now classify this input and provide the output in this format and do not include additional information beyond what is asked in the JSON output:

Input: {{{abstract_text}}}

Output (JSON only):
"""

    try:
        # Use the latest stable Gemini model, as we learned older names can be deprecated

        # Clean the response to ensure it's valid JSON
        clean_response = response.text.strip().replace("```json", "").replace("```", "")
        
        # Parse the JSON string into a Python dictionary
        result = json.loads(clean_response)
        return result

    except Exception as e:

        st.error(f"An error occurred. It could be an API quota issue or a malformed response from the model. Details: {e}")

    "and, at last, to cardiac failure. The use of anti-ferroptosis drugs combined with treatments able to activate "
